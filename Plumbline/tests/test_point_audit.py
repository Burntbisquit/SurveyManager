"""The Point(s) Audit (item 17): the job's field points against the state they were imported in.

The change list asked for a *"Point(s) Audit" report* and recorded the decision with it: the audit
reads against **the imported state**, not a baseline the user marks by hand, so the same report
says the same thing tomorrow.  That makes the baseline something the program has to keep, because
nothing before this recorded what a point *was* when it arrived - and two of the four questions an
audit is asked (*which imported points are gone*, *which ones moved*) cannot be answered from the
live point set at all, since a deleted point takes its own evidence with it.

What is checked here: that every import door writes the record, that all four answers come back
right (missing, added, moved, changed), that a change of coordinate system is not mistaken for
every point on the job moving, that the record survives a save, a load and an undo, and that the
report is in the Reports menu where the item said it would be.
