"""Field-to-Finish code tables -> Plumbline's own feature codes.

A *Field-to-Finish* (F2F) file is a surveying office's code standard in a spreadsheet: one row
per field code, saying what the code is called, which CAD layer it draws on, which symbol it puts
down, and whether it draws a point, a line or a polygon.  Carlson Software's is the one that
arrives in Texas, and it is a large table - the office standard in the samples folder is 1,717
codes over 216 layers, 249 columns wide.

Plumbline already holds the other half of it: *code -> layer + symbol + kind*.  Converting is
therefore a rename, not a translation, which is why it is worth doing here instead of asking
somebody to retype a code table:

    Code          ->  FeatureCode.code      (upper-cased - Plumbline's codes are upper case)
    Description   ->  FeatureCode.name
    Layer         ->  FeatureCode.layer
    Symbol        ->  FeatureCode.symbol    ("cross" when the file is silent)
    Entity Type   ->  FeatureCode.kind      Point -> point; Line / 2D|3D Polyline / Arc -> line;
                                            Circle / Polygon -> polygon.  Anything that draws a
                                            line also becomes a TIN breakline, because the
                                            office's linework is the office's breaklines.
    Category      ->  the layer, when the row has no layer of its own

Two things about the *shape* of these files are why this is not a five-line CSV reader:

* **The column positions are not the facts.**  Carlson's own export puts Code, Description,
  Symbol and Symbol Size first, then Layer and Entity Type in the **fifth and sixth** columns;
  a reader that takes the first six columns in order reads Symbol Size as the layer and Entity
  Type as something else, and every code silently lands on a number.  So the facts are found
  **by column name** first - the header row is full of them, "Layer", "Entity Type" - and
  Carlson's own positions are only the fallback for a file whose headers were renamed.
* **The category is a row, not a column.**  ``Category,Corners,,,,...`` sits above the group of
  codes it labels.  Reading it as a code puts a code called "Category" in the table; skipping it
  loses the only hint about what to do with the rows that carry no layer of their own.

The other half of the job is the user's: :func:`read` gives the rows, :func:`auto_map` says where
the facts were found and how, and the conversion dialog lets every column be pointed at by hand
(the headers may be ignored entirely) and every row be ticked or left out before anything in the
job is touched.
