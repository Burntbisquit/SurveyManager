"""The shape of a survey job folder, and the machinery to create one.

A job folder is the thing that outlives the software.  Three years from now someone
opens ``23-036.03/`` and has to find the raw download, the code table that decoded
it, the control, and the last drawing without asking anybody.  This module is that
convention written down once, so New Project, the field-data importer and the
sample-data builder all produce the same layout.

    <Job>/
        <Job>.plb               the Plumbline project (single file, opens by double-click)
        Field Data/             raw downloads, exactly as they came off the collector
            (whatever you name it)/       one folder per download, per week, per crew
                Crew 6/                    numbered from the point-number blocks
        Field Book/             the F2F / code table, code commands, correction rules
        Control/                control points, coordinate-system record
        Drawings/               DXF and PDF
        Surfaces/               surface exports, volumes
        Imagery/                aerials, KMZ for Google Earth
        Reports/                check reports, point lists, data-quality reports

Everything here is Qt-free so the CLI, the tests and the GUI all use one
implementation.  Creation is **cancelable and rolled back**: if a user cancels
half-way through, the job does not exist in a half-made state that a later
"create" would refuse to write into.

#: What goes inside Field Data/ when a job is created.  It is a *note*, not a folder: the

One folder per download, named the way your office names them.  Any of these is right:

    Week 1/  Crew 6/          a week of work, one folder per crew
    Stage 2/  Setout/         by stage, or by what the crew was doing
    2026-07-22/               by the date the file came off the collector
    North line/               by the area

Nothing in this program depends on those names.  The Fieldwork Manager reads every
field file under Field Data, whichever folder it is in, and works the crew out from the
point numbers themselves - so a new week, a new crew or a new naming scheme costs nothing.

The raw download is the record: keep the files exactly as they came off the collector here,
and let everything else (the consolidated file, the drawing, the surface) live where the job
folder says it lives.
