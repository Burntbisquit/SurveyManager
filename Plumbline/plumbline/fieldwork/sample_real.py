"""Build the "Real World" sample job out of a real field download.

Plumbline's shipped sample is synthetic: a computer-generated commercial lot chosen
so the tutorial has something to click on.  It has one honest weakness - nobody has
ever reduced real field data through this program.  This module fixes that by
turning an actual reduced job (a Carlson consolidated .fwk, its F2F code table and
the check report the office produced) into a browsable job folder:

    Real World/
        Real World.plb                  opens in Plumbline, CRS assigned
        Field Data/Week 1/
            Week 1 Consolidated.fwk     every crew, in shoot order
            Crew 6/  Crew 7/  Crew 9/   one folder per crew, named from the point blocks
        Field Book/                     the office's 1,717-code standard
        Control/                        the shared control points, pulled out of the data
        Reports/                        the real check report
        Source/                         the files exactly as they arrived

Crew numbers are not invented and not typed in by hand - they are *decoded* from the
point numbers using the same rule Fieldwork Manager uses for renumbering.  So a real
job's folder names come out of the data itself, which is the only way they stay right
when a new week arrives.

Nothing here hard-codes a job.  Point the builder at any .fwk and it will work out
the crews, the sensors and the point ranges for itself.
