"""Linework, read whole: the issues one description cannot show, and the tools for them.

Every other check in this program reads **one point at a time**. A line is a sequence: a point may
carry a valid description while the line has no semantic End Line/Close, or a curve may start without
an End Curve. The two ends of one mistake usually sit on **two different points**, which is why the
tool that fixes them has to be allowed to clear a second flag it was not aimed at.

The Field Book's meanings define the valid order::

    Start Line → Start Curve → End Curve → End Line / Close

A fix that appends a command to the end of the description can therefore still be wrong - which is
exactly why every fix here is **proposed, then validated**: the proposal is offered, and after it is
applied the line is read again, because the only honest answer to "did that help?" is to look.

This module is Qt-free on purpose: the field window's Line Repair tab and the drawing window's
Check Fieldwork dock both use it, and neither should be able to disagree with the other about
where a line ends.
