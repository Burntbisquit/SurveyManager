"""Synthetic sample site (a small commercial lot with a street) used by the tutorial, screenshots and tests.

Everything here is computer-generated - it is NOT a real survey.  Coordinates sit in NAD83(2011) / Texas
North Central (US survey feet, EPSG:6584) near Mesquite, TX so the CRS tools and imagery have a plausible
place to land; change the project CRS (Coordinates > Project Coordinate System > Assign) to move it anywhere.

The sample is built the long way round on purpose: the points are written out as a field download, then run
through the same Fieldwork Manager code path a real job takes (read -> check -> import -> code -> linework).
So `python -m plumbline sample` is an end-to-end test of the merged program, not just a pretty picture.

The synthetic site uses Carlson Field-to-Finish command meanings and representative codes from the
shipped office F2F reference: ``EA ST``, ``FNC X``, ``T14 / OAK``, and ``NG``. This keeps the tutorial
project synthetic while exercising the same start/end/close and description conventions as a field book.
The untouched real-world source remains a separate, real reduced survey in ``samples/Real World``.

For real field data, see :func:`plumbline.fieldwork.sample_real.build_real_world_sample`.

A computer-generated commercial lot with a street, written out the way a field crew's
download would arrive. **Not a real survey** - terrain is a plane plus a hill plus a
drainage swale, and the point numbers run 1 to 238 in shooting order.

| | |
|---|---|
| Points | {s['usable']:,} |
| Rows in the download | {s['rows']:,} |
| Coordinate system | {SAMPLE_CRS_LABEL} |
| Duplicate point numbers | {result['duplicate_numbers']} |
| Check findings | {result['flagged_rows']} |

## Why there are no problems in here

The synthetic site is deliberately **clean**: every point number is unique and no two
shots land on top of each other. That makes it the right sample for learning the
drawing tools, and the wrong one for seeing the checks work.

The check report in `Reports/` therefore says "0 findings" and means it.

Descriptions use Carlson Field-to-Finish meanings represented by the shipped F2F reference:
`EA ST` / `EA END` for line boundaries, `FNC X` for a closed feature, `T14 / OAK` for a code plus
note, and `NG` for natural-ground shots. The project and its Field Book are synthetic.

For a job with real problems in it - three crews, one shared control, genuine duplicate
point numbers, descriptions that do not parse - open **Real World**, the other shipped
sample. That one is a real reduced survey.

## What is here

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `Sample Job.plb` | the project - open this |
| `Field Data/Week 1/Week 1 Consolidated.fwk` | the download as one file |
| `Field Data/Week 1/{SAMPLE_CREW_FOLDER}/` | the same points as the crew's own file |
| `Field Book/Sample Job.fwb` | the code table this job was shot against |
| `Reports/` | the check report |

## Things to try

1. **Draw > Polyline**, then **Surface > Create Surface** and **Volumes**.
2. **Survey > Data Quality Check** - nothing to find here, but the tool runs.
3. **Coordinates > Project Coordinate System** and *Reproject* to EPSG:6583 (the metre
   version of the same zone) - the coordinates convert, the drawing does not move.
4. **Survey > Fieldwork Manager** and open `Field Data/Week 1/` to see the field side
   of the same points.
