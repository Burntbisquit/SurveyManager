"""File > Project Folder... - one door for the folder the job lives in.

The change order (item 12) put it plainly: *"too many folder options - Location and project must
be one folder with subfolders, not two entries."*  The two entries were **Select Job Folder** and
**New Job Folder**, and the third folder question lived inside New Project as "Location".  They are
all the same decision - *where does this job live* - so they are one dialog:

* **Open the folder this job is in** (and reveal it in the desktop's file manager);
* **Open another folder** - and if it holds a project file, offer to open that project, with
  overwrite offered second and explained in full (``ui.job_setup.overwrite_job_folder``);
* **Create a job folder** named after the job, inside the current directory by default, with the
  folder tree as its subfolders.

Nothing here writes anything by itself: creating goes through ``run_job_setup``, which is
cancelable and rolls back, and overwriting goes through the three-step confirmation.
